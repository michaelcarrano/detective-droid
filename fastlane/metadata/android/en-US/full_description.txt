Detective Droid is here to help you investigate what libraries are being used inside applications that are installed on your device.

This makes it really easy to see what other developers/companies are using to develop their applications.

Detective Droid requires no permissions and works on Android version 2.2 and beyond.

Detective Droid is available on Github:

Please help out, if you know how.
