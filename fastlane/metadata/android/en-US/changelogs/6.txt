Been a while!
This is a major update for the app, where everything has been re-developed from the ground up... And still does not need any permissions!

- No longer scans all the apps up front, jump straight to the list of apps installed on your device.
- Scan for known libraries once you click on an app you are interested in learning about. Really fast!
- Support for dark mode!
- New app icon.

Go do some detective work!
