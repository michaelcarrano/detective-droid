Detective Droid is here to help you investigate what libraries are being used inside applications that are installed on your device.

This makes it really easy to see what other developers/companies are using to develop their applications.

Detective Droid requires no permissions and works on Android API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) and newer.

- **Andriod 11**: Changes in Android 11 require a permission in order to get the list of apps installed on the user's device. You can read more about this change: [https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/package-visibility](https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/package-visibility)


## Limitations
Detective Droid is unable to detect libraries that are obfuscated with Proguard/R8. Additionally, unable to detect libraries that are dynamically created. For instance, [LeadBolt](http://leadbolt.com) creates their SDK on the fly for each developer which means a unique Classpath.


## Credits
Daniel Bjorge - Detective Droid is inspired by his [AirPush Detector](https://github.com/dbjorge/AirPush-Detector) project.

Josef Pfleger - The logic of detecting libraries in other applications comes from his article, [APK piracy](http://www-jo.se/f.pfleger/apk-piracy).
